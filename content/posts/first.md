Hello folks! Shubham here. I have been working in various roles related with cloud operations and devops since a while now. When I first told my peers and family members, that I was starting my career as a DevOps Engineer straight away after graduation, the confused look on their faces was priceless. It was only later, that I realized that this confusion is also widespread in the industry itself. There is no standard definition of what DevOps exactly is. To some its another cool name given to system administrators after ops and sysops, for others its about using various toolsets and technologies to automate the redundant tasks.

Take any class, be it online or offline, people usually show you an infinity symbol to represent a never ending process, with their own interpretation of its various stages. In essence, DevOps can be anything, that a team or organization defines it to be. A culture, a role, a profession etc.
Being so open to interpretation, people often mix other related roles or field, as responsibilities are shifted left and right, interesting new sandwich like combos are created, such as: MLOps, DataOps, AIOps, GitOps, DevCloudOps, DevDataOps, DevDBOps, DevSecOps, DevMasalaPaneerDosaOps and whatnot! It can be sometimes quite overwhelming for beginners and experienced folks alike, to figure out what exactly they are supposed to do/know in order to fulfill their personal as well as professional goals.
Knowing all this, I am myself still trying to look for certain way of defining my role/situation/position, but in reality, the most fun of working in this role is the uncertainty! You never know what tool/technology/platform will be thrown at you master, implement, take ownership of, since its not about the tool, or established processes. Its about the adventure that never ends.
So, while dealing with all this uncertainty, the outcome of the efforts of a DevOps professional is a stable, scalable and reliable application, that can handle changes stoically, and for me that is the definition of DevOps as profession.
The loop not only represents the various stages of software development lifecycle and continuously evolving systems, but also continuous evolution of the teams ,the individuals, the organizations that set onto this journey.
With this blog, Iâ€™d want to share my experiences of the journey, and would love to hear what you (the readers) have to say. This way we can help each other to learn and grow with shared experiences.
