Early in my career, a seasoned developer tossed out a question that echoed like a gauntlet: "DevOps? Isn't it just glorified support?"
It stung, especially as a college grad facing a mountain of unfamiliar acronyms and intricate automation protocols.
Why did building "layers and layers of automation" seem essential? What tangible impact did it truly have?

Instead of bowing to his apparent authority or launching into a defensive tirade, I chose a different path.
This wasn't just a job I stumbled into; it was a conscious choice, and before convincing anyone else, I needed my own answers.
So began a personal quest, fueled by a desire to understand not just the "what" of DevOps, but the profound "why" that
resonated deeper than lines of code or automated scripts.

Fast forward a few years, and I have far better answers than that bewildered graduate. In this post, I'll share them with you –
not just to dispel the "glorified support" myth, but to unveil the transformative power of DevOps.

## This is not a history lesson

Enough has been said and written about how the DevOps movement came to be and how it chagnes the way the software is delivered.
If you want to learn more about that, I encourage you to read books like The Phoenix Project by Geane Kim, that can paint you a
picture of how things were before the advent of DevOps. That is understanding is certainly something good to have, since eventhough
things have changed a lot since then, and DevOps is now more or less a norm than a radical idea, with much more mature processes,
automations, toolchains to deal with diverse requirements of different teams, yet the problems that DevOps emerged as
a solution to back then and those it solves now are quite similar.

## Dealing with the chaos: Problems solved and value delivered

The inherent value of DevOps, comes from how it enables organisations to continuously deliver new features, changes and updates
to the end users while dealing with the chos of large scale software development that brings with it, the follwing challenges:

1. Silos and Miscommunication: Gone are the days of developers tossing code over a wall to operations like medieval catapults.
   DevOps fosters collaboration and shared responsibility, breaking down silos and ensuring everyone speaks the same language.
   Imagine developers understanding infrastructure needs and operations having visibility into development processes.

2. Slow Releases and Bottlenecks: DevOps embraces continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), automating tasks and
   streamlining deployments. Think lightning-fast updates, pushed confidently and frequently, keeping users happy.

3. Buggy Software and Frustrated Users: DevOps emphasizes automated testing and quality assurance, ensuring code stability and
   catching problems early.

4. Infrastructure Headaches and Scaling Struggles: Managing servers and infrastructure can be a complex beast. DevOps promotes
   infrastructure as code (IaC), treating infrastructure like code for automated provisioning and scaling. Imagine pre-fabricated
   building blocks you can easily deploy and manage, scaling your software city effortlessly as your user base grows.

5. Unclear Ownership and Accountability: Who's responsible for that critical issue? Finger-pointing in siloed environments creates
   confusion and delays. DevOps fosters a culture of shared ownership, where everyone takes responsibility for the entire software
   lifecycle.

6. Shift Left Security: Traditional approaches treat security as a "gatekeeper" at the end of the development cycle, filtering out
   vulnerabilities. DevOps advocates for a "shift left" mentality, where security considerations are embedded throughout the entire
   process. DevOps teams leverage security automation tools like static code analysis and dynamic application security testing (DAST)
   to identify vulnerabilities early and often.

## Beyond Problem-Solving: Delivering Tangible Value

DevOps isn't just about fixing problems; it's about unlocking immense business value. Here's how:

- Enhanced Speed and Agility: Faster releases translate to quicker innovation and adaptation to market demands.
- Improved Quality and Reliability: Fewer bugs and smoother operation translate to happier users and a stronger brand reputation.
- Reduced Costs and Waste: Automation eliminates manual tasks and optimizes resource usage. Also, Identifying and fixing vulnerabilities
  early saves time, money, and reputational damage compared to fixing them later in the cycle.
- Boosted Team Collaboration and Morale: Shared goals and transparent communication foster a culture of collaboration and high team morale,
  ultimately leading to increased productivity and innovation.

## Conclusion

So, the next time someone questions the value of DevOps, remember – it's not just about glorified support, nor it it limited to mastering
different tools. It's about revolutionizing how software is built, delivered, and experienced. It's about harnessing the power of collaboration
and automation to unlock innovation, build resilience, and stay ahead of the curve.
